    // PLAY (4 digit code): text
    // i.e
    // PLAY(ER): blah blah blah
    // when editing script, the game works out who is talking by the first 4 characters.
    // then remvos the first 6 characters the start at the start of the script

    // IDEAS TO CONTINUE THIS IN A FUTURE PROJECT
    // Could potentially write an effects system by having like {EFFECT:screen_shake} placed within
    // if the text rendered gets to a {, it could stop writing to figure out the effect, play the effect, then continue past the closing }
    // ability to change speed of text drawing from script {TEXT_SPEED:0.01}
    // ability to have 2 characters talking at once, i.e one at top, one at bottom
    // in the case of the final script the player could be whispering to themself while the master is yelling about how much better they feel
    // ability to have text automatically go to next line of script... useful for sarcastic situations where the text really isn't useful
    // also, similarly to the above point, the master's text could be automatically going through multiple lines, while the player controls the bottom text
    // ability to play sfx from script i.e {SFX:bang}
    // ability to pause the rendering of text i.e {PAUSE}
    //requiring player input to continue mid line
    //The effects should keep whoever was currently talking on screen
    //The ability to change level/scene {LVL:CREDITS} or {LVL:GAME}
